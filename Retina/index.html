They are types of neurons and are located in the front of the retina. They are the cells that transfer information from the other neurons in the retina to the neurons in the brain. They receive inputs from amacrine cells and bipolar cells. When they output a message, it is transported very far so it is encoded in neural impulses. There are many different types of ganglion cells, each which perform a slightly different function and have different responses to light.<br><u><bold>Interdisciplinary Connection:</u></bold> the ganglion cell acts as the wire from the eye to the brain and is very similar to a wire from a camera to a computer. The ganglion cell converts the raw image from our eyes into data that our brain can process, like an ADC converter converts analog camera data into digital computer data. However, the ganglion cell encodes the data in neural impulses, while the ADC encodes the data in numbers. The way a ganglion cell encodes its data is comparable to the way an analog television transmitter encodes its video to send to an analog television."+ "<br>".repeat(10);
